Bucky tube is a one-dimensional quantum material with a special structure (radial dimension is on the order of nanometers, axial dimension is on the order of micrometers, and both ends of the tube are basically sealed). Bucky tubes are mainly composed of several to dozens of layers of coaxial circular tubes of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal shape. A fixed distance is maintained between layers, about 0.34 nm, and the diameter is generally 2 to 20 nm. And according to the different orientations of the carbon hexagon along the axial direction, it can be divided into three types: zigzag, armchair and spiral. The helical buckytubes have chirality, while the zigzag and armchair carbon nanotubes have no chirality.

Bucky tubes, as one-dimensional nanomaterials, are light in weight, with perfectly connected hexagonal structures, and possess many unusual mechanical, electrical and chemical properties.
