Neodymium Nitrate is a highly water soluble crystalline neodymium source for uses compatible with nitrates and lower (acidic) pH; we also produce Neodymium Nitrate Hydrate (CAS 13746-96-8) and Neodymium Nitrate Hexahydrate (CAS 16454-60-7) . Nitrate compounds are generally soluble in water. Nitrate materials are also oxidizing agents. When mixed with hydrocarbons, nitrate compounds can form a flammable mixture. Nitrates are excellent precursors for production of ultra high purity compounds and certain catalyst and nanoscalematerials (nanoparticles and nanopowders) . All metallic nitrates are inorganic salts of a given metal cation and the nitrate anion. The nitrate anion is a univalent (-1 charge) polyatomic ion composed of a single nitrogen atom ionically bound to three oxygen atoms (Symbol: NO3) for a total formula weight of 62.05. Primary applications include lasers, glass coloring and tinting, and dielectrics. Neodymium nitrate is generally immediately available in most volumes. Ultra high purity and high purity compositions improve both optical quality and usefulness as scientific standards. Nanoscale elemental powders and suspensions, as alternative high surface area forms, may be considered.
