Pure molybdenum belongs to the group of refractory metals. Refractory metal refers to the metal whose melting point is higher than platinum (1772 ?). In refractory metals, the binding energy of a single metal atom is particularly large. At the same time, it has high melting point, low vapor pressure, high elastic modulus and high thermal stability. In addition, it shows the typical characteristics of low thermal expansion coefficient and high density.
