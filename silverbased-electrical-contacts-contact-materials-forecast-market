Electrical contacts are soft, high-conductivity, oxidation-resistant materials used as the makeup of electrical components. They are the materials in a system through which an electrical current flows.

Electrical contacts are generally made from metals with high electrical conductivity. The most commonly used metal surfaces for contact alloys are silver, copper and other auxiliary metal, like gold, platinum, and palladium. Tungsten, nickel, graphite, and molybdenum are materials that enhance the structural properties of highly conductive metals and some are used individually for specialized contacts and components. Compared with National Bureau of Statistics of China and Customs, in this report, the sales volume was counted by using total weight (1 MT = 1 Ton) of contact materials.
